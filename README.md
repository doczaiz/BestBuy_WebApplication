Project Description
The Software Testing Agent project is a dedicated initiative to ensure the quality and reliability of the Best Buy e-commerce platform. This project focuses on functional testing of critical user-facing modules such as User Account, Main Menu, Search Functionality, Shopping Cart, Product Details Page (PDP), Checkout Process, Deals & Promotions, Location Services, and Customer Support & Engagement. Led by Rachid Zaizouny, a seasoned Software Quality Assurance Engineer with over 6 years of experience in manual and automation testing, the project aims to validate seamless user experiences, identify defects in key workflows, and support release recommendations through structured test planning and execution. The scope includes live environment testing on the public-facing site to reflect real-world interactions, ensuring robust performance for end users.

Installation Instructions
To set up the Software Testing Agent project environment for contributing to or utilizing the test plans and resources for Best Buy e-commerce testing, follow these detailed steps. These instructions are designed for users with basic to advanced technical skills and assume access to standard software tools.

Prerequisites Setup:

Hardware: Ensure you have access to a Windows PC or MacBook for desktop testing, and optionally an iPhone, Android Smartphone, or iPad for responsive mobile testing.
Software: Install the latest versions of web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Additionally, install a test management tool such as Jira for tracking test cases and defects (optional but recommended).
Network: Confirm you have a stable, high-speed internet connection to access the live Best Buy site at https://www.bestbuy.com/.
Clone or Download Project Resources:

If a repository is established (e.g., on GitHub), clone it to your local machine using Git with the command git clone <repository-url> (URL to be provided if applicable). Alternatively, download the project files as a ZIP if hosted on a platform like GitHub.
If no repository exists yet, download the Test Plan document and associated resources directly from shared links or project folders provided by the project lead.
Set Up Test Documentation Environment:

Install Microsoft Word or a compatible word processor like LibreOffice Writer to view and edit test plan documents (e.g., BestBuy_Functional_Test_Plan.docx).
Open the Test Plan HTML or DOCX file to familiarize yourself with the modules (User Account, Main Menu, etc.) and testing approach outlined in the plan.
Configure Test Environment:

No specific software installation is required beyond browsers for accessing the live Best Buy site at https://www.bestbuy.com/, as testing is conducted on the public-facing production environment.
If using a test management tool like Jira, log in with provided credentials or set up a project space titled "Best Buy E-commerce Testing" to organize test cases and defect reports.
Verify Setup:

Navigate to https://www.bestbuy.com/ in each browser to confirm accessibility and basic functionality (e.g., homepage loads, Sign In link visible).
Ensure you can access and edit the Test Plan document in your word processor for reference during testing activities.
If you encounter issues during setup (e.g., browser compatibility or document access), refer to the Contact Details section below for support.

Usage Guidelines
The Software Testing Agent project resources are designed to guide functional testing of the Best Buy e-commerce platform. Below are guidelines to effectively utilize the provided materials, suitable for both manual and automation testers.

Purpose: Use the Test Plan document (BestBuy_Functional_Test_Plan.docx or HTML version) as the primary reference for understanding the scope, modules, and testing approach. It outlines critical areas like User Account authentication, Shopping Cart operations, and Checkout flows on https://www.bestbuy.com/.
Accessing the Site: Open your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and navigate to https://www.bestbuy.com/ to begin testing. Ensure you test across desktop and mobile viewports to validate responsiveness.
Following the Test Plan: Focus on the prioritized modules (P1: User Account, Search Functionality, Shopping Cart, Checkout Process; P2: Main Menu, Product Details Page, Location Services; P3: Deals & Promotions, Customer Support & Engagement) as detailed in the Test Plan. Adhere to the entry/exit criteria and risk-based prioritization for efficient testing.
Recording Results: Document observations, defects, and status in a test management tool like Jira or in a local spreadsheet if no tool is set up. Include screenshots or videos for defect evidence, referencing the specific module (e.g., "Shopping Cart - Quantity Update Error").
Example Workflow:
Start with the User Account module by navigating to the Sign In page on https://www.bestbuy.com/.
Attempt login with provided test credentials (or create a test account if permitted).
Verify successful authentication and header personalization, noting any deviations.
Move to the next module (Main Menu) and repeat the validation process per the Test Plan guidelines.
This structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage across all specified modules.
If you need sample test data (e.g., accounts or promo codes), contact the project lead as outlined in the Contact Details section.
