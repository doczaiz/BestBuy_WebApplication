    <div class="section">
        <h2>3.0 Functional Scope and Features to Be Tested</h2>
        <p>This section identifies the modules and functionalities of the Best Buy e-commerce platform targeted for functional testing. The focus is on verifying happy-path scenarios, input validations, error handling, state transitions, data persistence, and user-visible calculations. The modules are prioritized based on their impact on user experience and revenue generation, as detailed below in the specified order:</p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Module: User Account</h3>
        <p>This module encompasses all functionalities related to user authentication and account management. Testing will validate sign-in/sign-out processes, user profile management, address book operations, order history access, saved items management, and session persistence features like "Remember Me." The goal is to ensure secure, accurate handling of user data and seamless access to personalized features.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Module: Main Menu</h3>
        <p>The Main Menu module includes the primary navigation structure of the website, typically located in the header. Testing will focus on the menu’s expand/collapse behavior, category links (e.g., Electronics, Appliances), sub-category navigation, and responsiveness across devices. The objective is to confirm that users can intuitively access all product categories and site sections without errors or broken links.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3 Module: Search Functionality</h3>
        <p>This module covers the search bar and associated features for finding products. Testing will address keyword search accuracy, autocomplete suggestions, no-result handling, filter application (e.g., price, brand), sorting options (e.g., price low to high), and result pagination. The aim is to ensure users can efficiently locate desired products with relevant, accurate results.</p>
        
        <h3>3.4 Module: Shopping Cart</h3>
        <p>The Shopping Cart module involves functionalities related to adding, managing, and reviewing items before checkout. Testing will verify item addition from product pages, quantity updates, item removal, subtotal and tax calculations (as displayed), promo code application, and the "Proceed to Checkout" flow. The focus is on ensuring a smooth, error-free cart experience critical to completing purchases.</p>
        
        <h3>3.5 Module: Product Details Page (PDP)</h3>
        <p>This module pertains to individual product pages where users view detailed information. Testing will cover product image display, specification accuracy, pricing (including discounts), variant selection (e.g., size, color), inventory status (ship/pickup availability), warranty options, and "Add to Cart" functionality. The goal is to validate that users receive accurate, comprehensive product data to inform purchase decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>3.6 Module: Checkout Process</h3>
        <p>The Checkout module includes the entire purchase completion flow. Testing will assess guest vs. registered user checkout, shipping address entry and validation, delivery vs. store pickup options, payment method selection and handoff to third-party gateways (initiation and return only), order review, and order confirmation. The objective is to ensure a frictionless, secure transaction process that maximizes conversion rates.</p>
        
        <h3>3.7 Module: Deals & Promotions</h3>
        <p>This module focuses on promotional content and special offers. Testing will validate navigation to sections like "Top Deals," "Deal of the Day," and "Outlet Deals," as well as the correct display of discounted prices, eligibility criteria, and associated links or calls-to-action. The aim is to confirm that marketing initiatives are accurately presented and accessible to users.</p>
        
        <h3>3.8 Module: Location Services</h3>
        <p>This module deals with store location selection and its impact on product availability and pickup options. Testing will verify the accuracy of the displayed store based on user input (ZIP code or geolocation), the ability to change locations, and the reflection of location-specific inventory or delivery options. The focus is on ensuring location-based personalization functions correctly.</p>
        
        <h3>3.9 Module: Customer Support & Engagement</h3>
        <p>This module includes features for user assistance, such as live chat or help resources. Testing will address the visibility and functionality of support icons or links, response initiation, and access to help pages or FAQs. The purpose is to ensure users can easily seek assistance when encountering issues during their journey.</p>
